        <h3> Hargeisa Cultural Center</h3>
        <p>The Hargeysa Cultural Center was opened in August 2014 in Somaliland.
          The Center was established by Redsea Cultural Foundation (RCF).</p>
        <p>Since its establishment,the Hargeysa Cultural Center has become an essential
          feature in Hargeysa’s cultural landscape. The success of the center</p>
        <p>owes much to the respect that RCF has gained from its work on running the annual
          Hargeysa International Book Fair, which, now in its twelve. Each year a country</p>
        <p>invites as a guest country and new theme introduces to discuss academically,
          and experience of political and personal.The 12th instalment of the annual</p>
        <p>Hargeysa International Book Fair will be held in July, from 20th to 25th, in Hargeysa,
          Somaliland, with the theme of coexistence and the guest country is Egypt.</p>

        <h3>12th Hargeysa International Book Fair – 20-25 July 2019, Hargeysa, Somaliland </h3>
        <p> The 12th instalment of the annual Hargeysa International Book Fair will be held in July,
          from 20th to 25th, in Hargeysa, Somaliland, with the theme of coexistence and the guest country of Egypt.</p>

        <h4>COEXISTENCE: The Theme of the Year (2019) </h4>

        <p> On its 12th anniversary, the Hargeysa International Book Fair (HIBF) has adopted the theme of 'Coexistence'
          to be central to the events of this year's Book Fair programme. Throughout the annals of history, all the
          conflicts for which humanity has paid in millions of human lives and immeasurable destruction of properties
          have been based on suspicion and hostility engendered by differences in creed and culture. Sadly enough, no
          continent in our planet today seems to be totally free from the scourge of political and ideological conflict.
          Albeit in varying degrees, the plight of war still remains a major concern of all countries in our boastful
          era of unimagined advancement in science and technology. That is why we zealously hold the principle of
          Peaceful Coexistence as the most cherished and practical idea for bringing together peoples and nations at
          variance in their political ideologies and national traditions to live in lasting peace and harmony. The same
          applies within intrastate and interstate social conflicts.</p>

        <p> Even in the current international quest for overcoming the challenges of global warming, it is rightly
          conjured that the realisation of peaceful coexistence is essentially seen as a requisite condition towards
          that objective. So far the themes explored at Hargeysa International Book Fair have included Freedom,
          Censorship,
          Citizenship, Collective memory, Visualization of the future, Journey, Imagination, Spaces, Leadership &
          Creativity, Connectivity and Wisdom. We will focus this year on the principle of peaceful coexistence of
          nations and people, in contrast to the antagonistic contradiction principal that nations with competing
          interest and ideologies could never coexist.</p>

        <p> The choice of peaceful coexistence as our theme of the year has not come about casually at all. It has
          always been our firm belief, in the Redsea Cultural Foundation, that the advocacy and upholding of this
          cardinal principle is the real test of our claim to genuine human civilisation. So, let us pool our efforts
          together in order to make this claim come true.</p>

        <h4>EGYPT: This Year's Guest Country</h4>
        <p>We take both great pride and pleasure to be hosting Egypt as our Guest Country for this yearâ€™s Hargeysa
          International Book Fair. The reasons for our choice are too many to relate in this brief introductory note.
          Suffice it to say that Egypt has a special place in the minds and living memory of the people of Somaliland.
          The future prospects of both countries also seem to be equally entangled.</p>

        <p> Despite the huge numerical difference in population and potentiality, yet the two countries share similar
          histories in that both are bound by the Islamic religion, they have experienced the rules of the Turks and
          later the British in the past century. Both occupy geopolitical strategies; Egypt at the Northern entrance of
          the Red Sea, and the people to people interaction is millennia old, with Somaliland located at the Southern
          post. Moreover, giving praise where it is due, there is hardly any country in the African continent in which
          Egypt has not left its marks in the spheres of education, politics, arts or culture. In Somaliland, the
          majority of our foreign educators and foreign health professionals are Egyptian, while global appreciation for
          Egyptian scholarship and academia in general is evident.</p>

        <p>By having Egypt as our Guest Country, we in the Redsea Cultural Foundation, look forward to hugely benefit
          from the distinguished scholars, artists and intellectuals who will surely bring along with them invaluable
          experience we are so eager to share. We most warmly welcome our highly reputed and respected Egyptian guests.
